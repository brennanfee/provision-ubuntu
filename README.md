# provision-ubuntu
Ansible scripts to provision my personal Ubuntu machines.

## Ubuntu Versions

At present these scripts assume Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  I will usually
the master branch up-to-date with the LTS editions.  As needed,
I might use a separate versioned branch for interim Ubuntu versions.

## Desktop Environments

At present I support only two desktop environments for configuration.
KDE and MATE.  It does mean that a "blank" or command-line only installation
is not possible with these scripts.
