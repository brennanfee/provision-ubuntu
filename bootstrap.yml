# The intent of the bootstrap script is to run it first thing on a machine.
# Given the chicken-and-egg situation with SSH a separate script is provided
# to be run on brand new machines that will provision the Ansible user.
# Once the Ansible user is provisioned this script should be run before any
# other Ansible provisioning.
- name: First-time setup
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - { role: upgrade, apt_upgrade_level: full }
    - base-packages
    - allow-sudo
    - ansible-user
    - ssh
# NOTE: Most of these roles can (and should) be reused in a more complete
# provision script.  However, the SSH role is touchy.  Some edits in that role
# could accidentally lock you out of a machine so it is recommended to omit
# that one role from any further Ansible playbooks.
